# Algorithms & data structures project

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer. This repository's goal is to demonstrate how to correctly implement common data structures and algorithms in the simplest and most elegant ways.

# Running an algorithm implementation

To compile and run any of the algorithms here, you need at least .NET Core 3.1. Gradle can make things more convenient for you, but it is not required.
